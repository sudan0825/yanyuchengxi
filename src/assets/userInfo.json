On the same note, people have complained about me replaying the same song again and again. I'm also a night owl. If i had my way, it would be perfectly normal to sleep in until the early afternoon. I enjoy road trips but I'm afraid i'm not the best road trip buddy as I'm naturally skilled in the art of falling asleep in the passenger's seat. I enjoy the everday activities from reading the newspaper, catching up on movies that everyone except me has seen, playing sports, to going out for a bite and drink with friends."

I'm a man's man that enjoys the violence and aggression of football (go Niners!), boxing, UFC, shooting guns and working on/ driving loud, fast cars, but I'm also a passionate, artistic romantic that enjoys musicals, the opera, museums and romantic comedies. I love wild crazy nights dancing to hip hop and house while drinking Fernet and Scotch, but I also love staying in an entire weekend to cook and binge on Netflix and video games.\nI'm definitely here to find someone special and would ultimately like to find a serious relationship, but that does not mean the journey there has to be serious... I am chill enough to know something worthwhile takes time, so I always try to go with the flow while laughing and smiling as much as possible along the way."
